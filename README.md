# Heart Disease Prediction – Exploratory Data Analysis

This project involves analyzing a medical dataset to understand patterns related to heart disease and identify key factors influencing the risk. The dataset includes patient-level attributes like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and ECG results.

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset consists of 14 attributes:

1. **Age** – Age of the patient (in years)  
2. **Sex** – Gender (1 = Male, 0 = Female)  
3. **ChestPain** – Type of chest pain:  
   - 1: Typical angina  
   - 2: Atypical angina  
   - 3: Non-anginal pain  
   - 4: Asymptomatic  
4. **Restbps** – Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)  
5. **Chol** – Serum cholesterol (mg/dL)  
6. **Fbs** – Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dL (1 = True, 0 = False)  
7. **RestECG** – Resting ECG results:  
   - 0: Normal  
   - 1: ST-T wave abnormality  
   - 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy  
8. **MaxHR** – Maximum heart rate achieved  
9. **Exang** – Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
10. **Oldpeak** – ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest  
11. **Slope** – Slope of peak exercise ST segment:  
    - 1: Upsloping  
    - 2: Flat  
    - 3: Downsloping  
12. **Ca** – Number of major vessels (0–3) colored by fluoroscopy  
13. **AHD (First Column)** – Type of defect:  
    - 0 = Normal  
    - 1 = Fixed defect  
    - 2 = Reversible defect  
14. **AHD (Final Column)** – Presence of heart disease (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical Analysis

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Explore and clean the dataset
- Analyze relationships between features and heart disease
- Identify patterns and trends to assist in early diagnosis

## 📈 Outcomes

This project helps to understand the underlying patterns in heart disease data, supports healthcare decisions, and lays the foundation for predictive modeling.

### ✅ Conclusion

The exploratory analysis revealed strong associations between heart disease and factors like chest pain type, cholesterol levels, ECG results, and exercise-induced angina. These insights can guide early diagnosis and form a base for predictive modeling in healthcare analytics.
